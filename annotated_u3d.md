# A Beginner Introduction to U3D Files

This post will serve as a simple introduction to the U3D file format specificaton for any person who needs to write an output or input stream for U3D objects or is genuinely interested in 3D formats.

This post will also contain an annotated U3D file an other important things which are needed to understand the file format and what all needs to be done to actually get your 3D data embedded into a U3D file that can later be embedded in a PDF file.

**NOTE This post follows the U3D file format specification which can be found at [File Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-363%204th%20Edition.pdf)**

## What is U3D?

Before we start looking at the U3D file format, for those who don't know what U3D is, this is an introduction section for U3D.
U3D is a compressed file format standard for 3D omputer graphics data.
The goal of U3D is to create a universal standarad for 3D data of all kinds, so as to make data exchange easier.

Personally, for my job, I have only used 3D data to write meshes with corresponding textures to a U3D object. Although, you can write a lot more cool stuff with U3D like animation data.\
