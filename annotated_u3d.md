This post will serve as a simple introduction to the U3D file format specificaton for any person who needs to write an output or input stream for U3D objects or is genuinely interested in 3D formats.

This post will also contain an annotated U3D file an other important things which are needed to understand the file format and what all needs to be done to actually get your 3D data embedded into a U3D file that can later be embedded in a PDF file.

**NOTE This post follows the U3D file format specification which can be found at [File Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-363%204th%20Edition.pdf)**
